Goals & Overall Architecture

Goals
	•	Automate the pipeline so that new blog content is generated without manual “python automated_blog_generator.py” invocation.
	•	Allow “reactive” generation: new generation triggered by arrival of new RSS feed content.
	•	Also allow “creative” generation: spawn new post ideas from existing content / via prompting the vector DB.
	•	Handle deduplication, quality control, scheduling, rollback.
	•	Provide monitoring, logging, and manual override capabilities.

Architecture Overview (Continuous Mode)

Here’s a conceptual flow:

[ Scheduler / Daemon / Worker ]  
     ├── Periodic RSS Fetch & Ingestion  
     │     └── fetcher module  
     │           └── parse new feed items → filter → store raw + metadata  
     │                → embed & upsert into Chroma  
     ├── Trigger / Queue new generation tasks  
     │     ├── “new feed-based” tasks (one per new item or cluster)  
     │     └── “creative” tasks (e.g. periodic idea generation)  
     ├── Generation / Agent pipeline  
     │     └── run RAG / agent orchestration (writing, editing)  
     │           → produce draft markdown + frontmatter  
     │           → validate / filter / scoring  
     └── Publication / Scheduling  
           └── commit to content/blog, or schedule future publish  
               → (optionally) regenerate Next.js or signal rebuild  

Key modules/components to add:
	•	A daemon / orchestrator / scheduler process (e.g. using cron, APScheduler, or a job queue like Celery / RQ / Prefect / Airflow)
	•	A task queue / job manager (so that tasks (fetch, ingest, generate) are decoupled)
	•	Enhanced deduplication / filtering logic (e.g. avoid reprocessing same RSS story, avoid generating redundant blog posts)
	•	Generation scheduler / policy, e.g. limits per day, priority, throttling
	•	Monitoring & logging, alerting on failures
	•	Manual override / review mode (drafts waiting for manual approve before publish)
	•	Rollback / safe publish (e.g. flag to disable publishing, ability to delete or unpublish)

Step-by-Step Plan & Checklist

Here is a stepwise plan. As you build, mark off each item.

Phase 0: Preliminary / scaffolding
	•	Fork / clone autoblog01, ensure tests & baseline generation still work
	•	Add configuration flags / environment variables to control “continuous mode” or “manual mode”
	•	Introduce a “daemon / runner” entrypoint (e.g. run_continuous.py or autoblog_daemon.py)
	•	Decide on scheduling / job framework (cron + APScheduler, or distributed queue, etc.)

Phase 1: RSS Fetching & Ingestion Enhancements
	•	Refactor fetcher to support incremental fetch
	•	Track last‐seen timestamp or GUID per feed
	•	Store metadata of processed feed entries
	•	Add logic to skip duplicates (e.g. same title, same link, or very high embedding similarity)
	•	Embed new content & upsert into Chroma DB
	•	If part of existing content, update vectors or metadata
	•	Tag / categorize feed items (e.g. feed source name, topic, category)
	•	Logging / error handling for feed failures (timeouts, parse errors)

Phase 2: Task Triggering & Queue
	•	Create a task/queue abstraction
	•	Could be in-process queue, or use Redis / RQ, or Celery
	•	When new feed items arrive, enqueue “generate_from_feed” tasks
	•	Optionally group similar items (clustering)
	•	Also enqueue “creative generation” tasks periodically
	•	E.g. every day, week — “generate new post idea from existing knowledge base”
	•	Ensure task deduplication / idempotence (if a task already in progress, don’t duplicate)
	•	Rate limiting / maximum concurrency (e.g. only 2 posts per hour, or X per day)

Phase 3: Generation Pipeline Integration
	•	Adapt existing automated_blog_generator.py (or agent modules) to be callable as a library function
	•	e.g. expose generate_from_feeds(feed_items, options)
	•	and generate_from_vectors(prompt, options)
	•	Add a “draft validation / scoring” step
	•	Check readability, lengths, duplication vs existing posts, keyword quality
	•	Reject or flag bad ones
	•	Attach metadata: which feed triggered it, generation timestamp, source embeddings, relevance score, etc.
	•	Support “dry run” / preview mode
	•	The generation task can produce a draft but not yet publish

Phase 4: Publication / Scheduling
	•	Decide publishing mode options
	•	Immediate publish
	•	Delayed scheduling (future publish date)
	•	Manual review / approval step
	•	Implement commit to content/blog/ (Next.js content)
	•	Write markdown + frontmatter
	•	Ensure correct date / slug / tags / categories
	•	Trigger Next.js rebuild / revalidation or notify frontend to re-render
	•	Depending on hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.), trigger incremental build / webhook
	•	Add “unpublish / delete draft” support

Phase 5: Monitoring, Alerts, Dashboard
	•	Logging infrastructure (log successes, failures, performance)
	•	Metrics / counters: feed fetch count, tasks generated, posts published, failures
	•	Dashboard / status command (CLI or simple web UI) to view pipeline status, queue lengths, errors
	•	Alerting / retry logic (on failures of tasks, feed fetch errors, LLM errors)
	•	Backoff / retries / circuit breaker

Phase 6: Quality & Safety Enhancements
	•	Duplicate detection / similarity threshold — avoid publishing posts too similar to existing ones
	•	Content filtering / safety — check for undesirable content (explicit, unwanted topics)
	•	Human review fallback — allow manual flags, veto, edits
	•	Rate limits / throttling — avoid “over generation”
	•	Versioning / backup of content so you can roll back

Phase 7: Deployment & Operationalization
	•	Decide deployment strategy (run daemon on server, serverless cron, container, etc.)
	•	Containerize / Dockerize the continuous runner if needed
	•	Set up environment / secrets / keys (LLM configs, DB URLs, etc.)
	•	Health check / liveness / watchdog
	•	Graceful shutdown / restart strategies
	•	Automated tests / integration testing for the continuous pipeline

⸻

Suggested Timeline & Priorities
	•	First deliverable: basic daemon + incremental RSS ingestion + task enqueuing + simple generation tasks (immediate publishes).
	•	Second: add scheduling / draft / validation / filtering.
	•	Third: monitoring, quality, safe guard rails.
	•	Fourth: full deployment, robustness, scalability.

You can also roll this out in stages: start with a daily cron job that triggers your existing pipeline, then gradually add real-time triggers and task orchestration.

Risks & Mitigations

Risk	Mitigation
Over-generation / spammy content	Rate limits, quality filters, manual review
Duplicate or redundant content	Use embedding similarity, duplicate detection
LLM / agent failures or timeouts	Retry logic, fallback, circuit breaker
Pipeline bottlenecks	Task queue, concurrency control
Hosting constraints (build time, API limits)	Incremental builds, segmentation of tasks
Drift in content / topic	Periodically review vector base, retrain prompts
